# 3D Gallery

The 3D gallery project aims to create an interactive virtual gallery using three.js, a popular JavaScript library that makes rendering and interacting with 3D objects easier, it abstracts the lower level details of having to deal with default browser 3D renderer... WebGL. The virtual gallery will serve as a platform to showcase artwork, or any other 3D visual content in an immersive and engaging manner. Users will be able to navigate through the gallery, view and interact with the displayed content.

## Development

### Setup Guide

1. Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asror1/gallery.git
```

2. Change directory

```sh
cd gallery
```

3. Install dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

4. Run the project

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Requirements

1. **Three.js Integration**: The project should utilize the three.js library to render 3D graphics and create the virtual environment. This includes setting up a scene, camera, lighting, and loading 3D models or images.

2. **Interactive Navigation**: Users should be able to navigate through the virtual gallery using intuitive controls, such as mouse or keyboard inputs. Implementing smooth camera movements and transitions will enhance the user experience.

3. **Artwork Display**: The project should provide a way to showcase artwork or visual content within the virtual gallery. This can be achieved by loading 3D models, images, or videos onto virtual walls or pedestals. Consider implementing interactive features like zooming, rotating, or information pop-ups for each artwork.

4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the virtual gallery is responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This will allow users to access and enjoy the project on various platforms, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

5. **Optimization**: Optimize the project for performance by considering techniques like texture compression, level of detail (LOD) models, and efficient rendering. This will ensure smooth and responsive interactions, even on devices with lower specifications.

6. **Purposeful Content**: Select and curate artwork or visual content that serves a purpose or conveys a meaningful message. This could include promoting a cause, raising awareness, or telling a story through the displayed content.

7. **User Interaction**: Implement interactive elements that encourage user engagement, such as allowing users to leave comments, share artwork on social media, or provide feedback. This will enhance the overall user experience and encourage community participation.

8. **Documentation**: Provide clear and concise documentation on how to use and navigate the virtual gallery. Include instructions on how to interact with the artwork, navigate through the space, and any additional features or functionalities.
